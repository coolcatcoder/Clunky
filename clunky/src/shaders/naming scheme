order of shader name stuff:
instancing (not instanced, is default),
lighting (unlit is default) (May mention lightin model.),
colour or uv, or other interesting characteristic
dimensions (last),

Example:
InstancedSimpleLitColour3D

Note that it does not need "Shader" on the end. It should already be a sub module of the Shader module
